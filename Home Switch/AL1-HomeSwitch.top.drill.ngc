(prerequisites)
(1. need a working probe)
(2. Zero your Z axis on or just above the surface)
(Note: The first probe will touch off Z to 0.000 when it first touches to copper, )
(all other probe values are relative to this first point)

G21 (millimeters)
G90 (absolute distance mode, not incremental)

(begin initial probe and set Z to 0)

(PROBECLOSE)

(This is the sub-procedure used for resetting the Z position)
(Refer to the log table above if it exists to reset Z to any of the log index's)
(Add X Y Z positions as arguments from the log table)
(Example usage. MDI: o100 call [43.567] [24.345] [-0.012])
o100 sub
	G0 Z2.5 (raise the tool above the board)
	M5 (make sure the spindle is stopped)
	M0 (pause for any probe wires to be attached)
	G0 X#1 Y#2 (move to X Y position)
	G38.2 Z-1.999 F20.0 (probe)
	G10 L20 P0 Z#3 (set Z to position)
	G0 Z2.5 (raise the tool above the board)
o100 endsub

(This is the sub-procedure used for returning to a position to continue engraving where you left off)
(Use this procedure to safely return to any X Y then continue the GCode file from that line)
(NOTE: The line number you return to must include X Y and Z coordinates)
(NOTE: You will need to restart from this line manually after this procedure completes)
(Example usage. MDI: o101 call [3.567] [4.345])
o101 sub
	G0 Z2.5 (raise the tool above the board)
	M5 (make sure the spindle is stopped)
	M0 (pause for any probe wires to be detached)
	G0 X#1 Y#2 (move to input X Y position)
	M3 (make sure the spindle is started)
o101 endsub

(Set S value to ensure Speed has a value otherwise the spindle will not start on an M3 command)
S20000

(The program will pause to allow the probe to be detached)
(press cycle start to resume from current line)
M0

(The original mill file is now rewritten with z depth replaced with a)
(bilinear interpolated value based on the initial probing)
